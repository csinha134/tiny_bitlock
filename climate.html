                <h4>Save energy at home</h4>
                <p>Improving your homeâ€™s energy efficiency, through better insulation for instance, or replacing your
                    oil or gas furnace with an electric heat pump can reduce your carbon footprint by up to 900
                    kilograms of CO2e per year.</p>

                <h4>Walk, bike, or take public transport</h4>
                <p>Walking or riding a bike instead of driving will reduce greenhouse gas emissions -- and help your
                    health and fitness. For longer distances, consider taking a train or bus. Living car-free can reduce
                    your carbon footprint by up to 2 tons of CO2e per year</p>

                <h4>Eat more vegetables</h4>
                <p>Eating more vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds, and less meat and dairy, can
                    significantly lower your environmental impact. Producing plant-based foods generally results in
                    fewer greenhouse gas emissions and requires less energy, land, and water.</p>

                <h4>Consider your travel</h4>
                <p>Airplanes burn large amounts of fossil fuels, producing significant greenhouse gas emissions. That
                    makes taking fewer flights one of the fastest ways to reduce your environmental impact. When you
                    can, meet virtually, take a train, or skip that long-distance trip altogether.</p>

                <h4>Throw away less food</h4>
                <p>When you throw food away, you're also wasting the resources and energy that were used to grow,
                    produce, package, and transport it. And when food rots in a landfill, it produces methane, a
                    powerful greenhouse gas.</p>

                <h4>Reduce, reuse, repair & recycle</h4>
                <p>Electronics, clothes, and other items we buy cause carbon emissions at each point in production, from
                    the extraction of raw materials to manufacturing and transporting goods to market. To protect our
                    climate, buy fewer things, shop second-hand, repair what you can, and recycle.</p>

                <h4>Change your home's source of energy</h4>
                <p>Ask your utility company if your home energy comes from oil, coal or gas. If possible, see if you can
                    switch to renewable sources such as wind or solar. Or install solar panels on your roof to generate
                    energy for your home.</p>

                <p>"If you plan to buy a car, consider going electric, with more and cheaper models coming on the
                    market. In many countries, electric cars help reduce air pollution and cause significantly fewer
                    greenhouse gas emissions than gas or diesel-powered vehicles.Switching to an electric vehicle can

                    services you support. To reduce your environmental impact, choose products from companies who use

                <p>Speak up and get others to join in taking action. It's one of the quickest and most effective ways to
                    make a difference. Talk to your neighbors, colleagues, friends, and family. Let business owners know
